Main protocols at lower layers

• ARP
• RARP
• IP
• ICMP
• TCP
• UDP






ARP

• ARP is a relatively simple request/reply protocol. 
• The source device broadcasts an ARP Request 

looking for a particular device based on its IP 
address. 

• That device responds with its hardware address 
in an ARP Reply message.



ARP Operation



RARP

• The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is 
the earliest and simplest protocol designed to allow 
a device to obtain an IP address for use on a TCP/IP 
network. 

• It is based directly on ARP and works in basically 
the same way, but in reverse: a device sends a 
request containing its hardware address and a 
device set up as an RARP server responds back with 
the device’s assigned IP address.



RARP Operation



Limitation of RARP
• Low-Level Hardware Orientation: RARP works using 

hardware broadcasts. This means an RARP server is needed 
on every network segment. 

• Manual Assignment: RARP allows hosts to configure 
themselves automatically, but the RARP server must still be 
set up with a manual table of bindings between hardware and 
IP addresses. These must be maintained for each server, 
which is again a lot of work on an administrator.

• Limited Information: RARP only provides a host with its 
IP address. It cannot provide other needed information such 
as, for example, a subnet mask or default gateway.



While the Internet Protocol has many functions and 
characteristics, it can be focused one primary purpose: the 
delivery of datagrams across an internetwork of connected 
networks

IP Functions

• Addressing
• Data Encapsulation and Formatting/Packaging
• Fragmentation and Reassembly
• Routing / Indirect Delivery



IP versions & IP related Protocols

• IP Version : IPv4 (RFC 791) , IPv6
• Related protocols:

▫ IP NAT (NAT)
▫ IP Security (IPSec)
▫ Mobile IP



Even though the name seems to imply that it's the fourth 
iteration of the key Internet Protocol, version 4 of IP was the 
first that was widely used in modern TCP/IP.



IP Address Overview & Fundamentals
Facilitates the delivery of datagrams across an Internetwork

Functions:

• Network Interface Identification: the IP address 

provides unique identification of the interface between a 

device and the network. 

• Routing: When the source and destination of an IP datagram 

are not on the same network, the datagram must be delivered 

“indirectly” using intermediate systems, a process called 

routing. 



Questions
• Number of IP Addresses Per Device ? 
• Which devices require an IP address ?



IP Address fundamentals

• Network-Specificity of IP Addresses

• Contrasting IP Addresses and Data Link Layer Addresses

IP Address Representations

• 32 bits long = 4,294,967,296 addresses
• Representations:



IP Address Structure
• Network Identifier (Network ID): A certain number of bits,

starting from the left-most bit, is used to identify the network where
the host or other network interface is located.

• Host Identifier (Host ID): The remainder of the bits are used to
identify the host on the network.

The dividing point of the 32-bit address is not fixed, but rather,
depends on a number of factors, and can occur in a variety of places,
including in the middle of a dotted-decimal octet.



NetID & HostID examples



Subnet mask
• A 32-bits long value which is used to identify the 

network id of an IP address.



Subnet mask notation

• Dotted Decimal: 
▫ 10.5.6.7/255.0.0.0, 
▫ 172.16.32.1/255.255.0.0, 
▫ 192.168.10.5/255.255.255.0

• Slash notation:
▫ 10.5.6.7/8, 
▫ 172.16.32.1/16, 
▫ 192.168.10.5/24



IP Address Categories

• Classful Addressing



IP Address Categories

• Classless Addressing



IP Class and Host Capablilities



Special IP Addresses

• Loopback : 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
• All Zeroes (0.0.0.x, 192.168.10.0), 
• All Ones (196.254.255.255)



Subnetting

• A “classful” network is subnetted by dividing its host ID 
portion, leaving some of the bits for the host ID while 
allocating others to a new subnet ID.

• These bits are then used to identify individual subnets 
within the network, into which hosts are assigned.



Determining the Subnet Mask of a 
Subnetted Network



Subnetting Design Trade-Off



Variable Length Subnet Masking

Problem: a company with class C network 
201.11.55.0/24 has 6 subnetworks in which:
• The first 4 subnets (S1, S2, S3, S4): 10 hosts 

each,
• The fifth subnet (S5): 50 hosts,
• The last subnet (S6): 100 hosts



Conventional subnetting

IP Address Management & Authorities

• The Need for Centralized Registration

• The Original IP Address Authority: IANA

• In the late 1990s, a new organization called the 
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
Numbers (ICANN) was created

The IPv4 datagram is conceptually divided into two pieces: the header
and the payload. The header contains addressing and control fields, 
while the payload carries the actual data to be sent over the 
internetwork. Unlike some message formats, IP datagrams do not have 
a footer following the payload.



IP Datagram Encapsulation



IP Datagram



IP Datagram size, MTU

• Datagram size = IP Header + TCP Header + 
Upper layer Header + Data 

• MTU: The size of the largest IP datagram that 
can be transmitted over a physical network






ICMP Message classes

• Error Messages:
▫ that are used to report problem conditions

• Informational messages
▫ that are used for diagnostics, testing and other 

purposes
