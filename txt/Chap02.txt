CHAPTER 2:
THE LINK LAYER &
ETHERNET

Contents
• Link layer functions and Terminologies

• Ethernet
• CSMA/CD
• Ethernet network devices

• Internetworking devices

Link Layer Functions
• Relies upon the physical layer to deliver a frame to a

neighbor connected by physical link.
• The hosts (stations) and routers in the communication

path are called nodes.
• The channels (wired, wireless or optical) connecting

adjacent nodes along the path are called links.
• Data is encapsulated in a layer-2 packet called a frame.

MAC & LLC Sublayers

Multiple Access Protocols
• There are two types of links:
• Point-to-point (PPP) and,
• Broadcast

MAC Protocols
1. Channel Partitioning,
2. Random Access,
3. Token Ring.

Channel Partitioning
• TDMA

• FDMA

Shard Ethernet & WLAN Random Access
• In these environment, each station transmits at the full link

rate (baseband), there is no a priori coordination among
stations → collisions are a regular occurrence.
• Random access MAC protocols:
• CSMA,
• CSMA/CD (Ethernet 802.3)

• CSMA/CA (Ethernet 802.11)

ETHERNET

Timeline
• 1973 – Documented the invention of Ethernet, building on the ALOHAnet

protocol (2.94Mbps),
• 1978 – Xerox developed X-Wire, a 10 Mbps Ethernet running on a

coaxial cable,
• 1979 – Intel, DEC, Xerox jointly develop an Ethernet specification based

on X-Wire. This group was called DIX.
• 1983 – 802.3 Specification approved by IEEE
• 1984 – ISO adopted IEEE 802.3
• 1985 – Twisted-pair Ethernet Hub
• 1987 – 3COM developed intelligent switching hubs
• 1992 – Fast Ethernet (100Mbps)

Topologies

CSMA/CD
• Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection
Action
Step 1

The Network Interface Card (NIC) receives a datagram from the
network layer and creates a frame

Step 2

If the NIC senses, via CSMA, that the channel is not being used, it
begins sending a frame. If the channel is busy, it waits for an idle
channel and then transmits

Step 3

If the NIC transmits the entire frame without detecting a collision, the
transmission is successful; if the NIC detects a collision, via CD,
while transmitting, the transmission is aborted and a jam signal, 48
bits in length, is sent to ensure that all other transmitters are aware
of the collision.

Step 4

After aborting, the NIC enters what is known as Exponential Backoff,
which is in essence an algorithm to produce a random waiting
period, and then returns to step 2

Ethernet Network & Devices
• 10BASE-5
• 10BASE-2
• 10BASE-T
• Fast Ethernet

• Gigabit Ethernet (GbE)

Ethernet Hubs

Ethernet Cables & Connectors

Cat-7 cables & RJ-45 connector

T568B

T568A vs. T568B

Straight-through vs. Cross-over

Gigabit Ethernet

Single-mode and Multi-mode Fiber

Optical Fiber structure

Ten Gigabit Ethernet (10G)
• Commonly employed in an organization’s backbones,

Wide/Metropolitan Area Networks (WAN/MAN) or data centers.
• Does not support CSMA/CD, but works only in conjunction with a

switch.

Collision Domain
A part of a network where packet collisions can
occur

Collision Domain

Collision Domain
• Expand network with Hub will enlarge collision

domain

Internetworking Devices
• Expanding network with internetworking devices avoids

widening collision domain

Bridge
• Learning

• Filtering
• Forwarding

Router

Cisco Router
