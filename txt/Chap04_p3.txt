Chapter 04:
TCP/IP Protocol suite

Overview
• IP key characteristics ?
▫ Connectionless, Unreliable and Unacknowledged.

• Fixing this problem: let the network layer (IP)
take care of basic data movement on the
internetwork, and define two protocols at the
transport layer.

TCP vs. UDP
• The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a fullfeatured, connection-oriented protocol that provides
acknowledged delivery of data while managing traffic
flow and handling issues such as congestion and
transmission loss.

• The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a much simpler
protocol that concentrates only on delivering data, to
maximize the speed of communication when the features
of TCP are not required.

Applications of TCP & UDP
• TCP Applications:
▫ Most “typical” applications need the reliability and other
services provided by TCP, and don't care about loss of a
small amount of performance to overhead (HTTP, FTP,
SMTP…)

• UDP Applications:
▫ The application doesn't really care if some of the data gets
lost (streaming video or multimedia)
▫ Applications that send very small amounts of data.

Multiplexing & Demultiplexing in TCP/IP

Transport Layer Addressing
• TCP/IP transport layer addressing is
accomplished using TCP and UDP ports. Each
port number within a particular IP device
identifies a particular software process.
• TCP and UDP port numbers are 16 bits → values
from 0 to 65,535.
• There are Source Ports and Destination Ports.

Source Ports and Destination Ports

Ephemeral Ports
Client/Server applications:
• Server processes listens on port in well-known or
registered port numbers range. They are used as the
destination port number in requests sent by clients.

• Client processes don't use well-known or registered
ports. Instead, each client process is assigned a
temporary port number for its use. This is

commonly called an ephemeral port number.

TCP/IP Sockets
• The overall identifier of a TCP/IP application
process on a device is the combination of its IP
address and port number, which is called a
socket.
<Host Name>:<Port Number>
Ex: http://10.0.0.1:3128
• This API for Windows is called Windows Sockets
or WinSock

The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) was developed for use by application
protocols that do not require reliability, acknowledgment or flow control
features at the transport layer.

UDP does not
• Establish connections before sending data,
• Provide acknowledgments to show that data was
received,
• Provide any guarantees that its messages will arrive.
• Detect lost messages and retransmit them,
• Ensure that data is received in the same order that
they were sent,
• Provide any mechanism to manage the flow of data
between devices, or handle congestion.

UDP Message format
• 8 bytes long

• Length: The length of the entire UDP datagram, including
both header and Data fields.
• Checksum: An optional 16-bit checksum computed over the
entire UDP datagram
