Protocol


A protocol defines the format and the order of messages
exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as

the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or
other event

The OSI Reference Model

OSI Reference Model


Physical Layer: Transmitting raw bits



Data Link Layer:
 Data is broken up in frames
 How to transmit using shared channel  Media Access Control

(MAC)



Network Layer:
 Addressing
 Routing
 Handling congestion



Transport Layer
 An Error-free point-to-point channel that delivers messages or

bytes in the order they are sent.

OSI Reference Model


Session Layer:
 Establish connection,
 Manage connection,
 Disconnect



Presentation Layer:
 The lower layers, which are mostly concerned with moving bits

around
 This layer is concerned with Syntax & Semantic of information

transmitted

The 802 Categories

The 802 Project Model


An IEEE’s project  build up a LAN standard,



Named for the year and month it began (1980, February),



Defined network standards for the physical components of a
network (NIC and cabling), that are accounted for in the physical
and data-link layers of the OSI reference model.

The 802 specifications
Set standard for


Network interface cards (NICs),



Local area network (LAN) components,



Components used to create twisted-pair and coaxial cable

networks.
The 802 specifications define the ways NICs access and transfer data
over physical media. These include connecting, maintaining, and
disconnecting network devices

Enhancements to the OSI Model


The physical layer and the data-link layer, define how multiple
computers can use the network simultaneously without interfering
with each other



The 802 standards committee divided the data-link layer into two
sublayers:



Logical Link Control (LLC) Establishing and terminating links,
controlling frame traffic, sequencing frames, and acknowledging

frames


Media Access Control (MAC) Managing media access, delimiting
frames, checking frame errors, and recognizing frame addresses

IEEE 802 Categories
Specification Description
802.1

Sets Internetworking standards related to network management.

802.1D

Interconnect multiple LAN segments (STP)

802.1q

VLAN

802.2

Defines the general standard for the data-link layer. The IEEE
divides this layer into two sub-layers: the LLC and MAC layers. The

MAC layer varies with different network types and is defined by
standard IEEE 802.3
802.3

Defines the MAC layer for bus networks that use Carrier-Sense
Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD).
This is the Ethernet Standard.

802.4

Defines the MAC layer for bus networks that use a token-passing

802.5

mechanism (Token Bus LAN).
Defines the MAC layer for token ring networks (Token Ring LAN).

IEEE 802 Categories
Specification

Description

802.6

Sets standards for metropolitan area networks (MANs). MANs are
usually characterized by very-high-speed connections using fiberoptic cables or other digital media.

802.11

Defines wireless network standards

802.15

Defines wireless personal area networks (WPAN)

802.15.1

Bluetooth

802.16

Defines broadband wireless standards (WiMAX)
